  ### Obecné 
  - Na Pyvu jsou přednášky většinou česky, pokud přijde někdo, kdo česky nerozumí, přepneme do angličtiny, pokud se na to přednášející cítí.
  - Kromě nealko a alko pití je možné se Na Věnečku najíst. Nabídka je proměnlivá a obvykle jde o 4 až 7 jídel od toastu, párků, přes bramborák se zelím, dršťkovou polévku a smažák v housce až po guláš nebo řízek.
  - **Nezapomeň s sebou vzít hotovost – neberou karty.**
  - Na Věnečku zavírají o půlnoci.
  
  ### General
  - Talks at Pyvo are mostly in Czech but it there’s somebody who doesn’t understand Czech talks are switched to English if the speaker is able to.
  - **Cash only payments – club doesn’t accept cards.**
  - Besides both soft drinks and beer it's possible to eat at the club. Choice is variable and consists of 4 to 7 options ranging from toast, sausages and soup to fried cheese in a bun, goulash or schnitzel.
  - Club closes at midnight.

- title: "DIY AI: Czech Language and Large Language Models"
  speakers: 
    - Petr Šimeček

    Let's play! And we'll have three toys to play with. The first toy will be a language model. Everyone has probably tried ChatGPT by now, but what if we don't want our data to leave our computer? What are our options and what will they cost us? And how do we choose which model we want? Our second toy will help us with that – language benchmarks. We'll look at two, introduced recently: CzechBench and BenCzechMark. We'll also try out how to quickly test a model using a small test sets (https://github.com/simecek/MiniCzechBenchmark). Getting an elephant into a fridge and a large language model onto a small computer isn't easy. That's where the sloth comes in (https://unsloth.ai/blog/contpretraining), our third toy. The sloth can make a small model behave like a big one in certain ways – and it even fits into Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com)!

- title: "Engineering in the Trenches: Realities of Payment Systems"
  speakers: 
    - Martin Zeman

    In this talk, we’ll dig into the gritty realities of payment systems integration — where expectations meet the hard truths of engineering at scale. I’ll share what it takes to lead through the chaos and build a stable, reliable payment system through stories of failures, pivots and team resilience.
